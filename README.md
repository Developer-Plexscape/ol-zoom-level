## Demo

You can test a fully functional working live demo [here](https://plexstaticweb.z6.web.core.windows.net/ol-zoom-level).

## Install

```sh
npm install ol-zoom-level
```

## Usage

To use ol-zoom-level, first you need to load OpenLayers javascript library along with its corresponsing CSS.

```sh
<script src="https://openlayers.org/en/v4.6.5/build/ol.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://openlayers.org/en/v4.6.5/css/ol.css" type="text/css">
```

Then, load the ol-zoom-level library from `node_modules`

```sh
<script src="./node_modules/ol-zoom-level/build.js"></script>
```

Finally, in your existing OpenLayers application, add ol-zoom-level HTML element and pass the OpenLayers map object as a property.

```sh
const zoomLevel = document.createElement('ol-zoom-level');

// map is the OpenLayers map object
zoomLevel.map = map;

document.body.appendChild(zoomLevel);
```

Please note that if you are creating the zoom level control synchronously with the creation of the map, you may need to introduce a timeout so that the map has enough time to instantiate.
