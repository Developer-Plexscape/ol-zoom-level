# Development

To get started locally, follow these instructions:

1. If you haven't done it already, [make a fork of this repo](https://github.com/Developer-Plexscape/ol-zoom-level/fork).
2. Clone to your local computer using `git`.
3. Make sure that you have Node 10 or later installed. See instructions [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
4. Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies.

## Usage

Run `npm start` to start the application. You will then be able to access it at http://localhost:4200

## Building

To build the application, you will need a Linux environment. In case you are in a Windows 10 machine you can install [Ubuntu Bash](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/install-win10) alternatively.

If that is the case consider installing the Node using a [package manager](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/).
